Receive load, 

monitoring system receives performance metrics. Depending on the thresholds you
set in Nagios, you get paged. 

You wake up at 2am. SSH to instances (*gasp!*) or update your Chef environment
attributes. Converge chef. Check if alerts clear.

Then finally go to sleep.

Dynamics where in the state of our system evolves and changes over time due to
several factors.

Notice how everything look the same. Except for an Ops person being woken up to

You may have to wake up if you didn't set the thermostat properly. But that's a
different problem for now.

I want to slap them with this book!

Sometimes people tend to automate things they don't understand that produces
surprising results.  Slow response to change in workload, wild oscillations when 
a configuration is changed.

Typical support requests to just restart.  The book is great in that it gives
practical guidelines to conduct experiments to find out the effect of your
configuration setting in a safe manner, automated or not.

And to learn the effectiveness of our automation or any improvement in our
processes, we basically look at the feedback of the output/ results of what we
did.

\startNote

Feedback control or control theory changes the approach in that the output is
the observed behavior. In this case, CPU utilization. The actual workload of
traffic affects the utilization but we can't do that much about it. You can't
stop people from buying thing in your shopping side.

Autoscaling is a great example of feedback control.


Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

System output : current CPU utilization

System input: number of instances in the replication controller

Target output : desired CPU utilization

Details:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.2/docs/design/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md#horizontalpodautoscaler-object
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/horizontal-pod-autoscaling/

\stopSlide

\startNote

Kubernetes has a basic facility for autoscaling Replicaton controller based on
CPU utilization.  It basically updates the number of instances of your container
based on the rules you set in the HPA API object.
