Receive load, 

monitoring system receives performance metrics. Depending on the thresholds you
set in Nagios, you get paged. 

You wake up at 2am. SSH to instances (*gasp!*) or update your Chef environment
attributes. Converge chef. Check if alerts clear.

Then finally go to sleep.

Dynamics where in the state of our system evolves and changes over time due to
several factors.

Notice how everything look the same. Except for an Ops person being woken up to
adjust the thermostat.

You may have to wake up if you didn't set the thermostat properly. But that's a
different problem for now.

I want to slap them with this book!

Sometimes people tend to automate things they don't understand that produces
surprising results.  Slow response to change in workload, wild oscillations when 
a configuration is changed.

Typical support requests to just restart.  The book is great in that it gives
practical guidelines to conduct experiments to find out the effect of your
configuration setting in a safe manner, automated or not.

And to learn the effectiveness of our automation or any improvement in our
processes, we basically look at the feedback of the output/ results of what we
did.
